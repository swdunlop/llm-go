// An interface allowing to compute ggml_cgraph with Metal
//
// This is a fully functional interface that extends ggml with GPU support for Apple devices.
// A similar interface can be created for other GPU backends (e.g. Vulkan, CUDA, OpenCL, etc.)
//
// How it works?
//
// As long as your program can create and evaluate a ggml_cgraph on the CPU, you can use this
// interface to evaluate the same graph on the GPU. Instead of using ggml_graph_compute(), you
// use ggml_metal_graph_compute() (or ggml_vulkan_graph_compute(), etc.)
//
// You only need to make sure that all memory buffers that you used during the graph creation
// are mapped to the device memory with the ggml_metal_add_buffer() function. This mapping is
// used during the graph evaluation to determine the arguments of the compute kernels.
//
// Synchronization between device and host memory (for example for input and output tensors)
// is done with the ggml_metal_set_tensor() and ggml_metal_get_tensor() functions.
